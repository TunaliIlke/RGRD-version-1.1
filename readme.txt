RADIAL GRADIENT AND RADIAL DEVIATION FEATURE EXTRACTION

ABOUT:

Please find MATLAB code for extracting radial gradient and radial deviation radiomic features using medical images ( CT, MRI, etc.).
  
To apply the algorithm, use the function is "extractRGRD.m". 

 
Please reference the below article if you use the features calculated by 
 this code.
